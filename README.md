## Names JJ! Thanks for stopping by! 🙏

Multilingual (English, Cantonese and some Japanese) app developer and educator based in Japan 🇯🇵  
I build mobile and desktop apps using Flutter, with a focus on tools that support education, language learning, and daily productivity.

A majority my projects are private (NDA), so if you want to see something from me please let me know and I'll recreate it (to avoid NDA lol)! They are mostly apps catered to teachers (for creating class plans, lessons, homwork and etc) and students (to practice their English speaking and reading).

### Public Repos!

Its a work in progress right now!
TLDR: its a 2D topdown RPG game that incorporates speech challenges via microphone

### 🔧 What I Do/Did
- Develop cross-platform apps with Flutter & JavaScript
- Build applications that help streamline English learning for young children (or adults).
- Taught STEM and currently teaching English to kids aged 4–10.
- Work with Google APIs (Sheets, Drive) to automate and simplify workflows.

## Welcome to JJs README!

Multilingual (English, Cantonese and some Japanese) app developer and educator based in Japan ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ  
I build mobile and desktop apps using Flutter, with a focus on tools that support education, language learning, and daily productivity.

A majority my projects are private (NDA), so if you want to see something from me please let me know and I'll recreate it (to avoid NDA lol)! They are mostly apps catered to teachers (for creating class plans, lessons, homwork and etc) and students (to practice their English speaking and reading).

### Public Repos!
-https://github.com/notjj1234/speaking_godot_game.git

Its a work in progress right now!
TLDR: its a 2D topdown RPG game that incorporates speech challenges via microphone

### ðŸŽ¸ A Bit More About Me

- Learning Japanese! Studying for N3
